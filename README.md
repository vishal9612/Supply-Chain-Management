# Supply-Chain-Management
The Supply Chain Management Project focuses on using machine learning and data analytics to optimize supply chain operations for a fashion and beauty startup. The dataset includes detailed information on product types, sales, revenue, stock levels, shipping data, supplier details, manufacturing costs, and transportation modes. The project's main objective is to implement a demand forecasting model using neural networks, enabling better inventory planning, supplier selection, and transportation management. The project begins with data preprocessing, where missing values are handled, time-based features are created, and categorical variables are encoded. A neural network model with three hidden layers is built to predict product demand, trained on historical sales data, and validated for accuracy using mean squared error. Visualizations, such as revenue distribution, shipping costs, and lead times, are used for exploratory data analysis, providing insights into supply chain efficiency and performance. The model's deployment involves saving it for future predictions, allowing real-time analysis and decision-making. This project highlights how machine learning can enhance supply chain operations by reducing stockouts, optimizing inventory, and improving overall efficiency, with the potential for regular updates to maintain accuracy.
